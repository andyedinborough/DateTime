DateTime
--------

This is my attempt at creating a wrapper for the JavaScript Date object to provide additional functionality--bringing the API more inline with the features and capabilities presented by the .NET Framework's System.DateTime object.

Also included is a date-picker control (__jquery.calendar.js__).
